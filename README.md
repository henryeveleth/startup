# startup
My startup script for PinchMe stuff. A whole bunch of windows will be launched.


### Usage
```
$ ./startup [option] [port]
```

The options are: **pinchme**, **seeker**, **ledger**, **profiler**, and **all**.
If you are just starting up one service, you can provide a port
or let it be a default value.

Beware: 'all' launches everything in one window!
